\chapter*{Executive Summary}
OSNAP has a significant number of declassified and classified assets that must be accounted for and audited in accordance with federal laws and regulations. The current practice of directorate level spreadsheets and databases has resulted in failed audits and assets silently going missing while in transit. The Logistical Operations Service Tracker (LOST) will unify asset tracking and management across all OSNAP divisions, reducing 
incidents of property loss and asset management overhead.

LOST provides a single point of truth for where OSNAP assets are located and associated ownership. Assets will be tracked at rest and periodically while in motion. Due to the classified nature of some OSNAP assets, LOST will implement access controls to limit data visibility based on the nature of the data and the requesting user.
